Excellent! The diagnostic results show that:

  1. cURL is properly installed with SSL support
  2. Credentials are set in environment variables
  3. The CHES API is reachable (got 404 which is expected for /health endpoint)
  4. BUT external internet access is blocked (Google times out)
  5. BC Gov Auth server is also blocked (dev.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca times out)

  This is a network/firewall issue. Your server can reach ches-dev.api.gov.bc.ca but NOT dev.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca for authentication. This suggests selective
   firewall rules.

  Here are your options:

  Option 1: Request Firewall Rule (Recommended)

  Contact your network administrator to whitelist:
  - dev.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca (port 443) - for authentication
  - loginproxy.gov.bc.ca (port 443) - for production auth

  Option 2: Use a Proxy Server

  If your organization has a proxy for external access:

● Write(inc/ches-client-proxy.php)
  ⎿  Wrote 226 lines to inc/ches-client-proxy.php
     <?php
     class CHESClient {
         private $clientId;
         private $clientSecret;
         private $baseUrl;
         private $token;
         private $tokenExpiry;
         private $proxyUrl;
         private $proxyAuth;
     … +216 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I've created a proxy-aware version of the CHES client. The issue is clear from the diagnostics:

  Your server can reach the CHES API directly (internal network) but cannot reach the authentication server (external network).

  To fix this, you need to:

  1. Ask your network team to open firewall access to:
    - dev.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca:443 (for development)
    - loginproxy.gov.bc.ca:443 (for production)
  2. Or, if you have a corporate proxy, set these environment variables in IIS:
  HTTP_PROXY=proxy.yourorg.gov.bc.ca:8080
  PROXY_AUTH=username:password (if needed)

  2. Then use the ches-client-proxy.php file instead of the regular one.
  3. As a temporary workaround, you could cache tokens manually, but this isn't recommended for production.

  The good news is that once you get the auth token, the actual CHES API calls will work since that server is reachable. The authentication server is the
  only bottleneck.

  Perfect! Here's the complete manual token caching workflow:

  Three Ways to Handle Token Caching

  1. Automatic Workflow (when auth server is accessible)

  The system automatically:
  - Gets tokens when needed
  - Caches them in /inc/cache/ches_token.json
  - Reuses them for ~55 minutes (with 5-minute safety buffer)
  - Falls back to expired tokens if auth fails

  2. Manual Token Setting (for your current situation)

  Step 1: Get a token from a machine with internet access:
  # On your local machine or dev server:
  php ches-get-token.php
  This will output the token and instructions.

  Step 2: Set the token on your production server:
  # Via command line:
  php ches-manual-token.php set "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" 3600

  # Or via web browser (after setting auth_key):
  /lsapp/ches-manual-token.php?auth_key=your-secret-key&action=set&token=YOUR_TOKEN&expires=3600

  3. Automated Token Refresh (scheduled task)

  You could set up a scheduled task on a machine WITH access to refresh tokens:

● Write(ches-get-token.php)
  ⎿  Error: Interrupted by user
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

● Write(ches-token-cron.php)
  ⎿  Wrote 85 lines to ches-token-cron.php                                   
     #!/usr/bin/env php
     <?php
     /**
      * Cron job to refresh CHES token
      * Run this every 45 minutes on a machine that can reach the auth server
      * It will update a shared location that your production server can read
      */
     $clientId = $_SERVER['CHES_CLIENT_ID'] ?? '';
     $clientSecret = $_SERVER['CHES_CLIENT_SECRET'] ?? '';
     … +75 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Key Benefits of This Approach

  1. Resilience: Works even when auth server is unreachable
  2. Efficiency: Reuses tokens across multiple requests
  3. Fallback: Uses expired tokens as last resort (often still work for a while)
  4. Flexible: Can manually set tokens or automate the process
  5. Secure: Cache directory is protected from web access

  Quick Commands

  Check token status:
  php ches-manual-token.php info

  Test email sending:
  php ches-manual-token.php test

  Clear cache (force refresh):
  php ches-manual-token.php clear

  Important Notes

  - Tokens typically last 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  - The cache automatically handles expiry with a 5-minute buffer
  - If you get 401 errors, the cache auto-clears for fresh token
  - Consider setting up the cron job on a machine with access for automatic refresh

  This solution lets you work around the firewall issue while waiting for proper network access to be configured.

This folder is a temporary measure to track the app files that live **outside the app folder**. On Kepler, where LSApp is currently hosted, lsapp itself lives in a sub-folder of the root folder. We also have another folder off root, named "learning" and that has a decades' worth of eLearning course content stored in it. But that /learning/ folder is **also** where we store forms and such that integrate with LSApp, but which need to be accessed by people who don't need or want access to the app itself; for example, our corporate learning partner request form lives in /learning/hub/partners/new-partner-form.php but that submits to /lsapp/course-create.php and the data goes into the LSApp database.

At some point in the not so distant future, we'll make the repo have an /lsapp/ and a /learning/ folder within it so that these files can be more properly mapped. Doing so is a bit of a can of worms due to the aformentioned fact that the /learning/ folder has dozens of courses worth of material in it (active and inactive) that we don't want to track in this repo. In the meantime, I'm just replicating the folder structure of the important bits directly inside here so that at least the code is backed up and has some version control applied to it.

# LSApp Version 2 Release Notes

I started to do a little bit to update the course change request form on 
Friday afternoon and once I fell down the rabbit hole of redesigning the 
course page, it avalanched on me from there to obbessively spending the
whole weekend giving the whole thing a facelift and adding numerous new
features and simplifications.

* Updated to Bootstrap 5.3 from BC Gov Bootstrap based on 4.3; badges pose particular hassle. Loss of BC Sans font and color scheme for now.
* New course taxonomies supported from main course index page, through to quick update tools on the index and the course page itself.
* Complete visual overhaul to simplify and move away from "cards".
* Course page redesign for re-organization and only showing in-progress change requests
    * 
* Dashboard complete re-design obviates need for main admin dashboard, exposing much more information in a more compact and efficient way.
* Footer added with links.
